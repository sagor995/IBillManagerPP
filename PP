The App does not transmit your data to any remote server, cloud service, or third‑party API. All data remains on your own device unless you explicitly export or share it.

3  How We Use Your Information

We use the data solely to:

Display dashboards, invoices, expenses, and other in‑app reports.

Remember your last login session and theme preference.

Generate client bills and staff salary records.

We do not use your information for analytics, marketing, or advertising.

4  Data Sharing & Disclosure

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any user information with third parties.

5  Data Security

The local SQLite database is stored in the App’s sandboxed internal storage, inaccessible to other apps.

Shared Preferences values are stored using the Android KeyStore encryption facility where available.

We use best‑practice safeguards to protect your data from unauthorised access.

However, please remember that no mobile platform can guarantee 100 % security. You are responsible for maintaining backup copies if desired.

6  Your Choices & Rights

Delete data: You may uninstall the App at any time; this will delete all locally‑stored data.

Export data: We plan to add an export feature in a future update.

Revoke consent: Stop using the App and uninstall it.

Because the App stores data only on your device, we cannot access or remove it for you.

7  Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for users aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

8  Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will post the new version in‑app and update the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after any revision constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
